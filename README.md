# Bird ID Assistant

## Goals

The overall goal of this project is to create a bird identification assistant based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The two main components are:

1. A vector database containing embeddings of documents with information about bird species
2. A Large Language Model assistant with access to said database which, when prompted with a description of a bird, retrieves the closest matching species document and provides an answer to the user

Some personal learning goals include:

1. Learning more about data collection via web scraping
2. Researching Python tools for converting HMTL / free text to a vector database
3. Familiarizing myself with different frameworks for RAG and learning how LLMs retrieve documents from an embedding space
4. Learning more about birds! :-)
